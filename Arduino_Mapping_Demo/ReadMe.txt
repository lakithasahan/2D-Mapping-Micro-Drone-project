Mapping Your Surroundings Using MATLAB and Arduino
------------------------------------------------
Description:
This project utilizes an Arduino board, a servo motor and an ultrasonic sensor to gather the data 
necessary to construct a "map" of the environment via MATLAB. 

To Run This Demo:
Step 1: Construct the circuit shown in the provided schematic
Step 2: Run the provided MATLAB script 

Notes:
1) The circuit schematic for the project has been included as "Arduino_Mapping_Schematic.png" along with the
MATLAB file for this demo. 

2) Low-cost ultrasonic sensors can be noisy so it may impact the performance of this project. A capacitor can be added between 
the power and ground pins of the sensor to help mitigate these undesirable results, however, it is not required for the project 
to function and does not guarantee performance enhancement.
